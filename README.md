# About This Project
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

I decided to create this editor because I found this challenge to be interesting and it was fun creating it. For UI components I have used prime react and to store the user data local storage has been used.

For home page animation Framer motion have been used, even though there is no complex animation still I wanted to try framer motion.
